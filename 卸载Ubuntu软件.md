The way of new hand:

If you don't know the name of the software:      
    
      #apt search <about program>     //Replace <about program> with the part of the application you want to uninstall.
      
If you want to know which software you have:

      #apt list
      
Then uninstall:

      #apt-get --purge remove <the full name of application>  //Data is pricious,be careful when you delete it.
      
Also you can use Ubuntu Software Center.=_=
